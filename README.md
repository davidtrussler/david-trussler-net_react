# david-trussler-net_react

This is an implementation of my personal website built with React.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - version 10.14.1
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)

## To clone and set up the project locally

- `git clone https://github.com/davidtrussler/david-trussler-net_react`
- `cd david-trussler-net_react`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

`npm start` runs the app in the development mode. The page will reload if you make edits.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Deploy to Heroku

This requires
- A [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) account
- [Heroku command-line tools](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

See my notes [here](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s336/nl/52980809/38aad69a-d098-4beb-bdb6-57ab40d57718/) for instructions. 

However this just deploys the app as it exists in the dev environment, it is not a server-rendered app, it still requires users to have JS enabled.
